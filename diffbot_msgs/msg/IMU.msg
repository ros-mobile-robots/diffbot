# This is a message to hold number of ticks from Encoders
Header header

# Use an array of size two of type int32 for the two encoders.
# int32 is used instead of int64 because it is not supporte by Arduino/Teensy.
# An overflow is also unlikely with the encoders of the DG01D-E 
# motor with its encoder because of its low encoder resolution
