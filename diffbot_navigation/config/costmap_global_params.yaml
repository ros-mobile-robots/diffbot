  # Specifies the delay in transform (tf) data that is tolerable in seconds.
  # This parameter serves as a safeguard to losing a link in the tf tree while
  # still allowing an amount of latency the user is comfortable with to exist in the system.
  # For example, a transform being 0.2 seconds out-of-date may be tolerable,
  # but a transform being 8 seconds out of date is not.
  # If the tf transform between the coordinate frames specified by the global_frame and
  # robot_base_frame parameters is transform_tolerance seconds older than ros::Time::now(),
  # then the navigation stack will stop the robot.
  transform_tolerance: 1.0

  # Whether or not to use the static map to initialize the costmap.
  # If the rolling_window parameter is set to true, this parameter must be set to false.
